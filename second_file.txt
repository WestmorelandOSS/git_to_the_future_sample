staging

commits are changes that are made

add changes 

git add <file or directory>

gid add . (I want the current directory)

git commit -m "added awesome feature that saved mankind"
	
	< 80 characters, make the past tense

master is your original copy

git checkout -b <branch name>

think of using rrm/new_directory     meaning my initials rrm/feature_branch
call the directory what the feature is to do
rrm/money_market_accounts

a branch is a series of changes, is actually creating a folder on your computer


go to https://try.gihub.io

never check out a new branch on a brand new repo

git reset --hard HEAD (reset to original - very destructive, use with care)

git GUI (Paul likes this)

Pull request. Used to submit code t

git reset file (unstage a file, do not use a branch name)

reset is a very destructive command

using -- instructs git to never use a branch
